# OpenSourceControlledEnvironments - WordPress-Style Roadmap

## Vision: Become the WordPress of Controlled Environment Agriculture
*A platform that's easy to install, simple to use, and infinitely extensible through plugins*

---

## Core Principles
1. **5-Minute Install** - Anyone can get started quickly
2. **Plugin Architecture** - Extend functionality without modifying core
3. **Theme System** - Customizable dashboards and interfaces  
4. **Hardware Agnostic** - Support any sensor/actuator through plugins
5. **API-First** - Everything accessible via API for integrations

---

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Platform (Weeks 1-4)
*Goal: A working system that monitors temperature/humidity and controls one relay*

### Week 1-2: Core Platform
```python
# Simple, working example that users can run immediately
from osce import ControlledEnvironment

# Initialize with auto-detection
env = ControlledEnvironment()

# Add sensor (auto-detects type)
env.add_sensor('temp_1', pin=4)

# Add actuator
env.add_actuator('light_1', pin=22, type='relay')

# Simple automation
env.add_rule(
    if_sensor='temp_1', above=28,
    then_actuator='light_1', set='off'
)

# Start monitoring
env.run()
```

**Deliverables:**
- One-line installer script: `curl -sSL https://get.osce.io | bash`
- Auto-detection for common sensors (DHT22, DS18B20)
- Web dashboard on `http://pi.local:8080`
- REST API with live documentation
- SQLite database (zero configuration)

### Week 3-4: Plugin System
```python
# Plugin structure
class OSCEPlugin:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.env = environment
        self.name = "My Plugin"
        self.version = "1.0"
    
    def activate(self):
        """Called when plugin is activated"""
        pass
    
    def get_widgets(self):
        """Return dashboard widgets"""
        return []
```

**Deliverables:**
- Plugin loader system
- Plugin marketplace website (like WordPress.org/plugins)
- Example plugins:

---

## Development Philosophy

### Core Must Be:
- **Stable** - Never break existing setups
- **Simple** - Complexity lives in plugins
- **Documented** - Everything has examples
- **Testable** - Every release is solid

### Plugins Can Be:
- **Experimental** - Try new ideas
- **Specialized** - Serve niche needs  
- **Complex** - Advanced features
- **Commercial** - Paid plugins are OK

---

## Technical Decisions

### Why These Choices:
1. **Python** - Easiest for Raspberry Pi community
2. **SQLite Default** - Zero configuration
3. **Web Interface** - No app needed
4. **REST API** - Universal integration
5. **Plugin Architecture** - Proven by WordPress

### Architecture:
```
Core (Small, Stable)
  ├── Plugin Loader
  ├── Hardware Abstraction
  ├── Web Server
  ├── API
  └── Basic Dashboard

Everything Else = Plugins
```

---

## Timeline Summary

**Weeks 1-4**: Working MVP that anyone can install and use
**Weeks 5-8**: Beautiful, user-friendly experience
**Weeks 9-12**: Plugin ecosystem launched
**Weeks 13-16**: Features that make it compelling
**Weeks 17-20**: Community and polish

**Total**: 20 weeks to "WordPress status" vs 24 weeks in original plan

## The Dream

In 2 years, someone says:
> "I need to automate my greenhouse"

And everyone responds:
> "Just use OSCE. It's like WordPress but for growing stuff. Install it, pick some plugins, and you're done."

That's the goal. Not to build everything, but to build a platform where everything can be built.
