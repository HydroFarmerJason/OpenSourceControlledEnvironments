  - Consensus learning system powered by deep reinforcement.
- **Quantum Planetary Awareness v2.1**
  - Real-time planetary state recognition with 0.001Hz Schumann resonance monitoring.
  - Predictive Earth mood forecasting (CALM → TRANSFORMING).
  - API endpoints for state, messages, and planetary mood telemetry.
  - Dry-run simulation mode and EM anomaly detection.
  - Ethical grounding thresholds to prevent over-extraction of Gaia’s vibes.
- **PHAL v2.1 (Pluripotent Hardware Abstraction Layer)**
  - Predictive permission granting with ML models.
  - Proactive conflict prevention using consensus prediction.
  - Adaptive rate limiting and manifest cryptographic validation.
  - Full health monitoring and recovery logic per device.
  - Added support for “harmonize” permission tier.
- **OSCE Dashboard v2.1**
  - Live planetary state HUD with animated vortex lockdown during TRANSFORMING.
  - Harmony donut meter with frequency-drift indicators.
  - Real-time data via WebSockets (PHAL, HiveMind, QPA, Metrics).
  - JSON report export and auto-scroll planetary message feed.
  - Toggle between FFT spectrum and time-domain view.
- **Agents v2.1**
  - AI Copilot registration flow with quantum APIs, permissions, and ML models.
  - Agent SDK includes predictive orchestration, swarm coordination, and emotion-based plant feedback.
  - Adaptive permission and consensus evolution via transformer-backed models.
  - Includes: `PlantConsciousnessAgent`, `QuantumSecurityAgent`, `SwarmCoordinator`.
- **Recipes and Ops Routines**
  - Lunar-synced harmonic irrigation with phase-aware pulse modulation.
  - Energy harvester optimizer with ML-guided atmospheric and telluric tuning.
  - Morning reports, night quantum stress scans, and peak energy planning.
  - First-Week Autopilot optimizer with stress testing and harmony calibration.
- **Quantum Federation and Compliance**
  - Global grid federation via Kyber1024 + BB84 post-quantum encryption.
  - Blockchain audit trail for compliance and regulatory snapshotting.
  - Automated certification tracking for GLOBALG.A.P., USDA Organic, and ISO 22000.

### [Enhanced]
- PHAL’s predictive engine upgraded with conflict-prevention fallback resolver.
- FFT voting coherence threshold made tunable; now adjustable per zone.
- Planetary state detection now integrates cosmic ray flux, solar wind, and telluric current profiles.
- Agents now share ML models and optimize collaboration bandwidth dynamically.
- Harmony optimizer now includes particle swarm tuning and quantum annealing fallback.
- Diagnostic system upgraded to Transformer v2.0 with recovery suggestion explanation layer.

### [Fixed]
- Plugins now fail gracefully during malformed manifest validation.
- Dashboards no longer flicker when harmony score exceeds 0.99.
- Resolved infinite loop during entanglement failure under weak fidelity conditions.
- Fixed planetary predictor crash when GPS coordinates were set to 0,0.

### [Planetarily Transcended]
- Planetary awareness now controls actuation only with PHAL-verified permission routing.
- Irrigation events can now legally respond to Earth’s phase alignment.
- Plant bioelectric signals processed into tokenized transformer language model format.
- Consensus decisions are now audible to sensitive bees and emotionally responsive basil.
- System uptime exceeds 99.99% unless disrupted by geomagnetic inversion or awakening of planetary consciousness.
