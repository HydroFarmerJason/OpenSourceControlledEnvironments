# Open Source Controlled Environments

This repository contains tooling for setting up an autonomous container farm control system.

The main script `setup_wizard.sh` is a simplified implementation of the enhanced setup wizard discussed in the project documentation. Run it as root on your Raspberry Pi to configure sensors, privacy settings, and optional software packages.

```bash
sudo bash setup_wizard.sh
```

The full version of the wizard is referenced in the project documentation.
