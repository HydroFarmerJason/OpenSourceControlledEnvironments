# Ethics Statement

## Purpose of This Project

This project was developed in response to the shutdown of Farmhand.ag, with the goal of preserving farmers' autonomy and access to local control systems. By providing an open-source, offline-capable alternative, it empowers growers to operate independently of centralized platforms.

## Ethical Use

The project is released with the intention of supporting ethical, sustainable, and community-driven practices. The freedoms granted by open-source licensing come with the hope that they are used to:

- Promote self-reliance and local resilience
- Respect the privacy and agency of growers
- Support educational and non-extractive use
- Encourage cooperation over competition

## Core Principles

- **Consent in Practice**: System behavior should be configurable and transparent. No function is hidden or imposed without user intent.
- **Memory is Sovereign**: Data belongs to the operator. Local logging is prioritized, and no cloud dependencies are required.
- **Freedom Through Functionality**: The tools should enhance agency, not limit it. Features should serve the grower, not a platform provider.

## Not Intended For

While this guide is open-source, it is not intended for use in systems designed for:

- Surveillance or behavioral manipulation
- Automated extraction of labor or biological input
- Exploitation of marginalized communities

## License Alignment

This project uses a **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License** for documentation, and the **MIT License** for code. These licenses ensure freedom of access and reuse, while requiring attribution and openness in derivative works.

Use this guide with care, respect, and purpose. Autonomy is not just a technical goal—it's an ethical one.
